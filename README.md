Voxel

Hi! I’m a hobbyist exploring indie game development. I love games like Minecraft and Terraria, and this project is my playground for experimenting with procedural world generation and voxel blocks.

The game is mainly built to run on PC, but a web version has been made, so it’s more accessible: [indievoxel.games](https://indievoxel.games)

It’s built in Rust with Bevy and runs on WebAssembly, so you can play it without installing anything.
